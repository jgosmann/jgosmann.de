title: "A Spiking Neuron Model of Word Associations for the Remote Associates Test"
---

Generating associations is important for cognitive tasks including language
acquisition and creative problem solving. It remains an open question how the
brain represents and processes associations. The Remote Associates Test (RAT) is
a task, originally used in creativity research, that is heavily dependent on
generating associations in a search for the solutions to individual RAT
problems. In this work we present a model that solves the test. Compared to
earlier modeling work on the RAT, our hybrid (i.e. non-developmental) model is
implemented in a spiking neural network by means of the Neural Engineering
Framework (NEF), demonstrating that it is possible for spiking neurons to be
organized to store the employed representations and to manipulate them. In
particular, the model shows that distributed representations can support
sophisticated linguistic processing. The model was validated on human behavioral
data including the typical length of response sequences and similarity
relationships in produced responses. These data suggest two cognitive processes
that are involved in solving the RAT: one process generates potential responses
and a second process filters the responses.
