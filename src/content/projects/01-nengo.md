I contributed to various parts of the Nengo neural network simulator, including
the core simulator, the web-based GUI, and Nengo SPA, an implementation of the
Semantic Pointer Architecture. In particular, I conceived and implemented an
optimizer increasing simulation times by almost a factor of 7. I also integrated
decoder caching and the progress bar. On the GUI side my main contributions are
related to refactoring and improving the websocket and HTTP server of the
backend.
