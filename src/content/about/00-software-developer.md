I am a jack of all trades, and master of at least some. Starting by putting
servers into racks, managing the infrastructure, developing a back end, and
ending by designing a front end, I do full stack development it its truest sense.
But if I had to chose, I would pick the software development and software
architecture aspects as the ones I enjoy most.

When I am writing code, I strive to keep it as simple as possible and to
express its intent concisely and precisely without useless embellishments.

In my free time, I mainain and contribute some small open source projects.
