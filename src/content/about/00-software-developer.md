Code is for humans. I am always striving to improve the quality,
maintainability, and readability of my code and software. This continuous
process started for me early with submissions to student computer science
competitions that were judged primarily on the raw source code. Sometimes more
important than writing new code is fixing bugs in existing code. In these cases
it is important to me to locate and resolve the root cause, rather than covering
up the symptoms.

These days I primarily write C# code at work and Python in my free time. I also
spend some time with JavaScript, TypeScript, and various frontend technologies
in both settings. See below for a [list of projects](#projects) I contributed
and continue to contribute to.
