title: "Optimizing Semantic Pointer Representations for Symbol-Like Processing in Spiking Neural Networks"
---

The Semantic Pointer Architecture (SPA) is a proposal of specifying the
computations and architectural elements needed to account for cognitive
functions. By means of the Neural Engineering Framework (NEF) this proposal can
be realized in a spiking neural network. However, in any such network each SPA
transformation will accumulate noise. By increasing the accuracy of common SPA
operations, the overall network performance can be increased considerably. As
well, the representations in such networks present a trade-off between being
able to represent all possible values and being only able to represent the most
likely values, but with high accuracy. We derive a heuristic to find the
near-optimal point in this trade-off. This allows us to improve the accuracy of
common SPA operations by up to 25 times. Ultimately, it allows for a reduction
of neuron number and a more efficient use of both traditional and neuromorphic
hardware, which we demonstrate here.
