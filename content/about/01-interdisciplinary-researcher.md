During my academic career I obtained degrees in <em>cognitive computer
science</em> and <em>computational neuroscience</em>. Currently, I am completing
my PhD in <em>systems design engineering</em>. This broad background allows me
to make sense of information from different research areas and draw connections
between them. During my doctoral studies I built a spiking neural network model
of short- and long-term memory that reproduces a number of findings from
neuroscience and psychology. Besides that I made various contributions that
advance the field of large-scale neural modelling. See below for a [list of
publications](#publications).
