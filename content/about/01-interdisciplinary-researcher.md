During my academic career I obtained degrees internationally in <em>Cognitive
Computer Science</em>, <em>Computational Neuroscience</em>, and a PhD in
<em>Systems Design Engineering</em>. This broad background allows me to make
sense of and integrate information from many different research area.  During my
doctoral studies I built a spiking neural network model of short- and long-term
memory that connects neuroscience and psychology.
Besides that I made various contributions that advance the field of large-scale
neural modelling.
