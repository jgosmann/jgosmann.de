Code is for humans. I am always striving to improve the quality,
maintainability, and readability of my code and software. This continuous
process started for me early with submissions to student computer science
competitions that were judged primarily on the raw source code. Sometimes more
important than writing new code is fixing bugs in existing code. In these cases
it is important to me to locate and resolve the root case, rather than covering
up the symptoms.

These days I primarily write Python code as it is awesome for the quick
prototyping and data analysis often necessary in research. See below for a [list
of projects](#projects) I contributed and continue to contribute to.
