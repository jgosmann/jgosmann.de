I taught myself programming around the age of 12 with QBasic, but quickly
venturing into other programming languages. At that time I ended up using C/C++.
I honed my skills by competing in student computer science competitions. In many
of these submissions were primarily graded on the source code itself. Thus, it
has been and continues to be important to me to write code readable by other
humans. These days I primarily write Python code as it is awesome for the quick
prototyping and data analysis often necessary in research. See below for a [list
of projects](#projects) I contributed to.
