When I started rock climbing in 2011, it quickly became another passion of mine.
The sport requires a unique combination of physical fitness, mental focus, and
problem solving. My forte tend to be technical slabs and I can be a quite
analytical climber, always trying to figure out why certain moves work or do not
work. Currently, I am working towards my goal of sending a climb graded 5.12
outdoors. I have climbed 5.12b indoors and my hardest climb outdoors is 5.11c, so
I am on a good track. See {{< ext "https://www.thecrag.com/climber/jgosmann" >}}my The Crag profile{{< /ext >}} for my
ascents.
